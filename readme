Certainly! Below is an expanded list of features for Antivirus Software integrated into developed applications and websites, categorized under System, Function, and UI, including support for the 3 actors (Admin, End-User, and Automated Security System). These features enhance virus scanning, threat handling, and efficiency of the app or website.

⸻

🔧 System Features (Backend & Infrastructure)
	1.	Multi-Engine Antivirus Support
	•	Use multiple antivirus engines (e.g., ClamAV, Bitdefender API) to improve detection accuracy.
	2.	Sandbox Execution
	•	Suspicious files are executed in an isolated environment to analyze behavior before allowing access.
	3.	Content Filtering
	•	Filters harmful scripts, macros, or embedded code from uploaded documents or forms.
	4.	Behavioral Analysis
	•	Detects abnormal or malicious behaviors (e.g., crypto-mining scripts, persistent cookies).
	5.	Automatic Definition Updates
	•	Ensures latest virus signatures are always used without manual intervention.
	6.	API Rate-Limiting for Security Scans
	•	Prevents abuse or DoS attacks by controlling the number of scan requests per user/IP.
	7.	Data Encryption & Secure File Handling
	•	Uses SSL/TLS and AES encryption for files scanned and stored to avoid interception or tampering.
	8.	Integration with DevOps Pipelines
	•	Automatically scans code during CI/CD deployment to prevent infected code from going live.
	9.	Incident Response Hooks
	•	Triggers automated actions (e.g., auto-ban user, notify support team, rollback file) on detection.
	10.	Geo-Tracking & IP Reputation Check

	•	Identifies threats based on location/IP reputation using threat intelligence.

🛡️ Functional Features (Threat Detection & Protection)
	1.	Deep File Type Analysis
	•	Scans beyond extensions—checks internal file headers for hidden threats.
	2.	Compressed File Scanning
	•	Opens and scans inside ZIP, RAR, TAR, etc., for embedded malware.
	3.	Real-Time Activity Monitoring
	•	Tracks user actions and system changes to detect injected scripts or anomalies.
	4.	Custom Threat Rules
	•	Admins can define specific rules for detecting or flagging certain file types, extensions, or content.
	5.	Self-Healing System
	•	Automatically repairs infected components or restores from clean backups.
	6.	Heuristic & AI Threat Detection
	•	Uses AI models to detect new or unknown malware based on behavior and structure.
	7.	Threat Severity Rating
	•	Labels threats as Low, Medium, or High to help prioritize response.
	8.	Incident Replay
	•	Allows Admin to “replay” the chain of events leading to a threat for forensic analysis.
	9.	Multi-Language Threat Detection
	•	Recognizes malicious code patterns in different programming languages (JS, PHP, Python, etc.).
	10.	Threat Sharing System

	•	Shares anonymized threat reports with external threat databases (e.g., VirusTotal community).

💻 UI Features (Interface for All Actors)

🧑‍💼 For Admin:
	1.	Interactive Threat Map
	•	Shows global origins of threats visually on a map.
	2.	Detailed Analytics Dashboard
	•	Includes graphs, timelines, and comparisons (e.g., week-by-week threats detected).
	3.	Manual File Rescan Button
	•	Allows Admin to trigger a rescan of previously uploaded or suspicious files.
	4.	Custom Notification Settings
	•	Choose how and when to get alerts (email, SMS, app notification, etc.).
	5.	Multi-Admin Role Access
	•	Assign roles like View-Only, Responder, or Super Admin for threat handling.

🧑 For End-Users:
	1.	Progressive File Scanner
	•	Shows upload progress, scanning animation, and final result in real-time.
	2.	Safe File Badge
	•	Adds a “Safe” or “Verified” label next to scanned items or user content.
	3.	Educational Tooltips
	•	Teaches users about safe file practices, what to avoid, and how to respond to virus alerts.
	4.	Feedback Form on Blocked Uploads
	•	Users can appeal or request manual review of wrongly flagged files.
	5.	Accessibility Support
	•	Fully responsive design with screen-reader compatibility and contrast modes.

🤖 For Automated Security System:
	1.	Log Compression & Archiving
	•	Archives old logs for audit purposes to reduce system load.
	2.	Auto-Threat Learning Loop
	•	Learns from past threats and improves detection rules dynamically.
	3.	Resource Optimization
	•	Runs scans with minimum CPU/memory usage to maintain application performance.
	4.	Failover Redundancy
	•	Keeps antivirus services running even if one scanner or service fails.
	5.	Load Balancing for Heavy Scanning
	•	Distributes scanning workload to maintain consistent performance under load.
